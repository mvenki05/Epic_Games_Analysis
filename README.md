# Epic Games Data Analysis
This project is an in-depth data analysis of a dataset related to Epic Games. The analysis focuses on understanding key metrics, identifying trends, and extracting actionable insights from the data. Using Python and libraries like pandas and matplotlib, I performed data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns related to user behavior, game performance, and sales metrics.

### Key objectives include:

- Identifying user engagement trends across various games and platforms.
- Analyzing sales and revenue patterns to determine the most successful products.
- Exploring the impact of promotions and events on user activity and sales.

This project showcases my ability to work with large datasets, apply data-driven methodologies, and present insights that can inform strategic decision-making.
